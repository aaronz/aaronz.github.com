There are also Shapeshift : https://github.com/McPants/jquery.shapeshift

and Gridly : http://ksylvest.github.io/jquery-gridly/

which are good alternatives to Gridster. (yet note that Gridly is for squared tiles only)

Edit : Packery is also very interesting : http://packery.metafizzy.co/ . However it requires a commercial licence for commercial project otherwise :


For non-commercial, personal, or open source projects and applications, you may use Packery under the terms of the GPL v3 License.

Edit 2 : This one may also be useful : https://github.com/uberVU/grid
