                <h2>Responsive vs Adaptive web design</h2>
                <p>
                    It might seem the same but it isn't. Both approaches complement each other, so there is no right or wrong way to do it. Let the content decide.

                <h2>The flow</h2>
                <p>
                    As screen sizes become smaller, content starts to take up more vertical space and anything below will be pushed down, it's called the flow.

                <h3 id="relativeunits">Relative units</h3>

                <p>The canvas can be a desktop, mobile screen or anything in between. Pixel density can also vary, so we need units that are flexible and work everywhere. That's where relative units like percents come in handy.

                <h3 id="breakpoints">Breakpoints</h3>

                <p>Breakpoints allow the layout to change at predefined points, i.e. having 3 columns on a desktop, but only 1 column on a mobile device. Usually where you put one depends on the content.
                </p>

                <h3 id="maxandminvalues">Max and Min values</h3>

                <p>Sometimes it's great that content takes up the whole width of a screen, like on a mobile device, but having the same content stretching to the whole width of your TV screen often makes less sense. This is why Min/Max values help.</p>

                <aside class="notes">
                    For example having width of 100% and Max width of 1000px would mean that content will fill the screen, but don't go over 1000px.</aside>

                <h3 id="nestedobjects">Nested objects</h3>

                <p>Remember the relative position? Having a lot of elements depending on each other would be difficult to control, therefore wrapping elements in a container keeps it way more understandable, clean and tidy.</p>

                <h3 id="mobileordesktopfirst">Mobile or Desktop first</h3>

                <p>Technically there isn't much of a difference if a project is started from a smaller screen to a bigger (mobile first) or vice versa (desktop first). Yet it adds extra limitations and helps you make decisions if you start with mobile first.</p>

                <h3 id="webfontsvssystemfonts">Webfonts vs System fonts</h3>

                <p>Wanna have a cool looking Futura or Didot on your website? Use webfonts! Although they will look stunning, remember that each will be downloaded and the more you'll have, the longer it will take to load the page.</p>

                <h3 id="bitmapimagesvsvectors">Bitmap images vs Vectors</h3>

                <p>Does your icon have lot of details and some fancy effects applied? If yes, use a bitmap. If not, consider using a vector image. For bitmaps use a jpg, png or a gif, for vectors the best choice would be a SVG or an icon font.</p>
