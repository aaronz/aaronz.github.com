                    <p>Users looking for specific information usually turn to search - so search should be one of the first things mobile users see on your site, avoid hiding it behind a menu. In the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/principles/research-study.html">study</a>, participants responded best to easily-visible, open text search boxes at the top of a page.</p>

                    <h2>Click to call</h2>
                    <p>On devices with phone capabilities, make it easy for users to directly connect with you by simply tapping a phone number, more commonly known as click to call.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wrap all phone numbers in hyperlinks with the <code>tel:</code> schema.</li>

                    <p>While many modern mobile browsers will automatically detect phone numbers and convert them to links, it’s a good idea to do this directly in your code. By manually tagging each phone number, you can ensure phone numbers are always enabled for click to call and that they will be styled to match your site.</p>
                    <p>To mark a phone number as a link, use the <code>tel:</code> scheme. The syntax is simple:</p><pre><code>NIST Telephone Time-of-Day Service &lt;a href="tel:+1-303-499-7111"&gt;+1 (303) 499-7111&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>Results in:</p>
                    <p>NIST Telephone Time-of-Day Service <a href="tel:+1-303-499-7111">+1 (303) 499-7111</a>

                    </p>
                    <p>Desktop browsers that don’t support voice calls will open the default telephony app on the computer, for example Google Voice or Microsoft Communicator.</p>

                    <h2 id="use-the-international-dialing-format">Use the international dialing format</h2>
                    <p>Always supply the phone number using the international dialing format: the plus sign (+), country code, area code and number. While not absolutely necessary, it’s a good idea to separate each segment of the number with a hyphen (-) for easier reading and better auto-detection.</p>

                    <p>Modern mobile browsers will automatically detect phone numbers and enable click to call. Mobile Safari automatically converts phone numbers to links with the associated hyperlink styles. Chrome for Android will automatically detect phone numbers and will allow users to click to call, but does not wrap them in hyperlinks or apply any special styles.</p>
                    <p>To prevent Mobile Safari from automatically detecting phone numbers, add the following meta tag to the top of the page:</p><pre><code>&lt;meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no"&gt;</code></pre>

                    <p>In addition to the <code>tel:</code> schema, some modern browsers also support the <code>sms:</code> and <code>mms:</code> schemas, though support is not as consistent, and some features like setting the message body don’t always work.</p>

                    <p>HTML5 introduced a number of new input types. These new input types give hints to the browser about what type of keyboard layout to display for on-screen keyboards. Users are more easily able to enter the required information without having to change their keyboard and only see the appropriate keys for that input type.</p>

                        <li>The <code>label</code> element provides direction to the user, telling them what information is needed in a form element. Each <code>label</code> is associated with an input element by placing it inside the <code>label</code> element, or by using the "<code>for</code>" attribute. </li>
                        <li>Applying labels to form elements also helps to improve the touch target size: the user can touch either the label or the input in order to place focus on the input element.</li>
                        <li>Labels and inputs should be large enough to be easy to press.</li>

                        <li>Placeholders disappear as soon as the user starts typing in an element, thus they are not a replacement for labels. They should be used as an aid to help guide users on the required format and content.</li>

                    <p>Browsers use many heuristics to determine which fields they can <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142893">auto-populate</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142893">based on previously specified data by the user</a>, and you can give hints to the browser by providing both the name attribute and the autocomplete attribute on each input element.</p>
                    <p>For example, to hint to the browser that it should auto-complete the form with the users name, email address and phone number, you should use:</p><pre><code>    &lt;label for="frmNameA"&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="name" id="frmNameA"
    placeholder="Full name" required autocomplete="name"&gt;
    &lt;label for="frmEmailA"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="email" name="email" id="frmEmailA"
      placeholder="name@example.com" required autocomplete="email"&gt;
    &lt;label for="frmEmailC"&gt;Confirm Email&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="email" name="emailC" id="frmEmailC"
      placeholder="name@example.com" required autocomplete="email"&gt;
    
    &lt;label for="frmPhoneNumA"&gt;Phone&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="tel" name="phone" id="frmPhoneNumA"
      placeholder="+1-555-555-1212" required autocomplete="tel"&gt;</code></pre>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Auto-complete only works when the form method is post.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>On some forms, for example the Google home page where the only thing you want the user to do is fill out a particular field, you can add the <code>autofocus</code> attribute. When set, desktop browsers immediately move the focus to the input field, making it easy for users to quickly begin using the form. Mobile browsers ignore the <code>autofocus</code> attribute, to prevent the keyboard from randomly appearing.</p>
                    <p>Be careful using the autofocus attribute because it will steal keyboard focus and potentially preventing the backspace character from being used for navigation.</p><pre><code>&lt;input type="text" autofocus ...&gt;</code></pre>

                        <li>Leverage the browser's built-in validation attributes like <code>pattern</code>, <code>required</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, etc.</li>
                        <li>Use JavaScript and the Constraints Validation API for more complex validation requirements.</li>
                        <li>Show validation errors in real time, and if the user tries to submit an invalid form, show all fields they need to fix.</li>

                <section>
                    <p>The <code>pattern</code> attribute specifies a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a> used to validate an input field. For example, to validate a US Zip code (5 digits, sometimes followed by a dash and an additional 4 digits), we would set the <code>pattern</code> like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;input type="text" pattern="^\d{5,6}(?:[-\s]\d{4})?$" ...&gt;</code></pre>
                </section>

                    <p>If the <code>required</code> attribute is present, then the field must contain a value before the form can be submitted. For example, to make the zip code required, we’d simply add the required attribute:</p><pre><code>&lt;input type="text" required pattern="^\d{5,6}(?:[-\s]\d{4})?$" ...&gt;</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>For numeric input types like number or range as well as date/time inputs, you can specify the minimum and maximum values, as well as how much they should each increment/decrement when adjusted by the slider or spinners. For example, a shoe size input would set a minumum size of 1 and a maximum size 13, with a step of 0.5</p><pre><code>&lt;input type="number" min="1" max="13" step="0.5" ...&gt;</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>The <code>maxlength</code> attribute can be used to specify the maximum length of an input or textbox and is useful when you want to limit the length of information that the user can provide. For example, if you want to limit a filename to 12 characters, you can use the following.</p><pre><code>&lt;input type="text" id="83filename" maxlength="12" ...&gt;</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>In some cases, you may want to allow the user to submit the form even if it contains invalid input. To do this, add the <code>novalidate</code> attribute to the form element, or individual input fields. In this case, all pseudo classes and JavaScript APIs will still allow you to check if the form validates.</p><pre><code>&lt;form role="form" novalidate&gt;
  &lt;label for="inpEmail"&gt;Email address&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="email" ...&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>Remember</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Even with client-side input validation, it is always important to validate data on the server to ensure consistency and security in your data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>When the built-in validation plus regular expressions aren’t enough, you can use the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/constraints.html#constraint-validation">Constraint Validation API</a>, a powerful tool for handling custom validation. The API allows you to do things like set a custom error, check whether an element is valid, and determine the reason that an element is invalid:</p>
                    <p>If a field fails validation, use <code>setCustomValidity()</code> to mark the field invalid and explain why the field didn’t validate. For example, a sign up form might ask the user to confirm their email address by entering it twice. Use the blur event on the second input to validate the two inputs and set the appropriate response. For example:</p><pre><code>    if (input.value != primaryEmail) {
      // the provided value doesn't match the primary email address
      input.setCustomValidity('The two email addresses must match.');
      console.log("E-mail addresses do not match", primaryEmail, input.value);
    } else {
      // input is valid -- reset the error message
      input.setCustomValidity('');
    }</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>Because not all browsers will prevent the user from submitting the form if there is invalid data, you should catch the submit event, and use the <code>checkValidity()</code> on the form element to determine if the form is valid. For example:</p><pre><code>    form.addEventListener("submit", function(evt) {
      if (form.checkValidity() === false) {
        evt.preventDefault();
        alert("Form is invalid - submission prevented!");
        return false;
      } else {
        // To prevent data from being sent, we've prevented submission
        // here, but normally this code block would not exist.
        evt.preventDefault();
        alert("Form is valid - submission prevented to protect privacy.");
        return false;
      }
    });</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>It’s helpful to provide a visual indication on each field that indicates whether the user has completed the form properly before they’ve submitted the form. HTML5 also introduces a number of new pseudo-classes that can be used to style inputs based on their value or attributes.</p>
                    <p>Validation happens immediately which means that when the page is loaded, fields may be marked as invalid, even though the user hasn’t had a chance to fill them in yet. It also means that as the user types, and it’s possible they’ll see the invalid style while typing. To prevent this, you can combine the CSS with JavaScript to only show invalid styling when the user has visited the field.</p>
                    <pre><code>    input.dirty:not(:focus):invalid {
      background-color: #FFD9D9;
    }
    input.dirty:not(:focus):valid {
      background-color: #D9FFD9;
    }</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section><pre><code>    var inputs = document.getElementsByTagName("input");
    var inputs_len = inputs.length;
    var addDirtyClass = function(evt) {
      sampleCompleted("Forms-order-dirty");
      evt.srcElement.classList.toggle("dirty", true);
    };
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; inputs_len; i++) {
      var input = inputs[i];
      input.addEventListener("blur", addDirtyClass);
      input.addEventListener("invalid", addDirtyClass);
      input.addEventListener("valid", addDirtyClass);
    }</code></pre>

                    <ul>
                        <li>You should show the user all of the issues on the form at once, rather than showing them one at a time.</li>

                    <p>Responsive web design, originally defined by <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">Ethan Marcotte in A List Apart</a> responds to the needs of the users and the devices they’re using. The layout changes based on the size and capabilities of the device. For example, on a phone, users would see content shown in a single column view; a tablet might show the same content in two columns.</p>

                    <p>Remember to use relative units when specifying widths for images to prevent them from accidentally overflowing the viewport. For example, <code>width: 50%;</code>, will cause the image width to be 50% of the containing element (not the viewport or actual pixel size).</p>
                    <p>Because CSS allows content to overflow its container, it may be necessary use max-width: 100% to prevent images and other content from overflowing. For example:</p><pre><code>img, embed, object, video {
  max-width: 100%;
}</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>Be sure to provide meaningful descriptions via the <code>alt</code> attribute on <code>img</code> elements; these help make your site more accessible by providing context to screen readers and other assistive technologies.</p>

                    <p>The <code>srcset</code> attribute enhances the behavior of the <code>img</code> element, making it easy to provide multiple image files for different device characteristics. Similar to the <code>image-set</code> <a href="images-in-css.html#use-image-set-to-provide-high-res-images">CSS function</a> native to CSS, <code>srcset</code> allows the browser to choose the best image depending on the characteristics of the device, for example using a 2x image on a 2x display, and potentially in the future, a 1x image on a 2x device when on a limited bandwidth network.</p><pre><code>&lt;img src="photo.png" srcset="photo@2x.png 2x" ...&gt;</code></pre>

                    <p>Changing images based on device characteristics, also known as art direction can be accomplished using the picture element. The <code>picture</code> element defines a declarative solution for providing multiple versions of an image based on different characteristics, like device size, device resolution, orientation, and more.</p>
                    <p><img alt="Art direction example" src="images/art-direction.png" srcset="images/art-direction.png 1x, images/art-direction-2x.png 2x" />

                    <p>Important</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <code>picture</code> element is beginning to land in browsers. Although it's not available in every browser yet, we recommend its use because of the strong backward compatibility and potential use of the <a href="http://picturefill.responsiveimages.org/">Picturefill polyfill</a>. See the <a href="http://responsiveimages.org/#implementation">ResponsiveImages.org</a> site for further details.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>The <code>picture</code> element should be used when an image source exists in multiple densities, or when a responsive design dictates a somewhat different image on some types of screens. Similar to the <code>video</code> element, multiple <code>source</code> elements can be included, making it possible to specify different image files depending on media queries or image format.</p><pre><code>    &lt;picture&gt;
      &lt;source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="head.jpg, head-2x.jpg 2x"&gt;
      &lt;source media="(min-width: 450px)" srcset="head-small.jpg, head-small-2x.jpg 2x"&gt;
      &lt;img src="head-fb.jpg" srcset="head-fb-2x.jpg 2x" &gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>Instead of supplying fixed image sizes and densities, the size of each supplied image can be specified by adding a width descriptor along with the size of the image element, allowing the browser to automatically calculate the effective pixel density and choose the best image to download.</p><pre><code>    &lt;img src="lighthouse-200.jpg" sizes="50vw"
         srcset="lighthouse-100.jpg 100w, lighthouse-200.jpg 200w,
                 lighthouse-400.jpg 400w, lighthouse-800.jpg 800w,
                 lighthouse-1000.jpg 1000w, lighthouse-1400.jpg 1400w,
                 lighthouse-1800.jpg 1800w"&gt;</code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>In many cases, the size or image may change depending on the site’s layout breakpoints. For example, on a small screen, you might want the image to span the full width of the viewport, while on larger screens, it should only take a small proportion.</p><pre><code>    &lt;img src="400.png"
         sizes="(min-width: 600px) 25vw, (min-width: 500px) 50vw, 100vw"
         srcset="100.png 100w, 200.png 200w, 400.png 400w,
                 800.png 800w, 1600.png 1600w, 2000.png 2000w"&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>The <code>sizes</code> attribute in the above example uses several media queries to specify the size of the image. When the browser width is greater than 600px, the image will be 25% of the viewport width, when it is between 500px and 600px, the image will be 50% of the viewport width, and below 500px, it will be full width.</p>

                    <p>As a web developer, having access to the user's location opens up a huge number of possibilities such as advanced filtering, pinpointing the user on a map, and offering pro-active suggestions on things the user can do based on their current position.</p>
                    <p>As a user, your physical location is a piece of information you want to guard and only give out to people that you trust. This is why the browser shows a prompt when a site asks for your location.</p>

                    <p>Our recommendation is to not tie your site or application in to requiring access to the user’s current location, but if your application or site absolutely requires it there are 3rd party solutions that allow you to obtain a best guess of where the person currently is.</p>
                    <p>These solutions often work by looking at the user’s IP address and mapping that to the physical addresses registered with the RIPE database. These locations are often not very accurate normally giving you a position of the nearest telecommunications hub to the user, or the nearest cell phone tower. In many cases, they might not even be that accurate, especially if the user is on VPN or some other proxy service.</p>

                    <p>Make sure users understand why you’re asking for their location, and what the benefit to them will be. Asking for it immediately on the homepage as the site loads results in a poor user experience.</p>
                    <p>Instead you should give the user a clear call-to-action or an indication that an operation will require access to their location. The user will then be able to more easily associate the system prompt for access with the action just initiated.</p>

                    <p>In some cases, the user became frustrated because they struggled to understand why they were being shown hotels in San Francisco when they wanted to book a room in Boston.</p>
                    <p>A better experience is to make sure users understands why you’re asking them for location. Add in a well known signifier that is common across devices, such as range finder.</p>
