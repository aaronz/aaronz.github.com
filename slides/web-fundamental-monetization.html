        <h2>Let users explore before they commit</h2>
        <p>Requiring login or account creation too early in a site experience can be detrimental to conversion.</p>
        <p>Before offering their personal information, users want to browse content and get a sense of what a site has to offer. In the study, many of the sites that participants rated the lowest were those where they were forced to create an account upfront in order to continue.</p>

        <h2>Let users purchase as a guest</h2>
        <p>Offer the option to check out as a guest, and encourage registration with tangible benefits.</p>
        <p>In a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/principles/">research study</a>, participants didn’t necessarily want to commit to creating an account with the retailer. Participants described the guest checkout as <b>"convenient"</b>, <b>"simple"</b>, and <b>"easy [and] quick"</b>. They were annoyed at a site that required registration to purchase, especially since the site didn’t explain how registration would benefit them.</p>

        <h2>Make it easy to finish on another device</h2>
        <p>Offer an easy way to save or share information across devices, for example provide a way for users to share items across social networks or to email a link directly within the site itself.</p>
        <p>There are many reasons a user might want to finish a task on another device, perhaps to see it on a bigger screen, or they get distracted and want to pick it up later. For instance, a career site allowed participants to email themselves jobs to apply for later.</p>

        <h2>Use existing information to maximize convenience</h2>
        <p>Take advantage of information you already have, and/or use third-party payment services to make conversion as easy as possible.</p>
        <p>For your registered users, remember and pre-fill their preferences. For new users, offer a third-party checkout service they may already use. Several retail sites in the study offered third-party payment services as an option, reducing purchasing friction for users of those services and allowing the site to prefill shipping info.</p>

        <h2>How ads work</h2>
        <p>At a glance, you make ad spaces (also known as ad inventory) available on your site. Advertisers bid to show their ads on your site and the highest bid wins. You get paid when users click on the ads.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>This guide covers the basics of how ads work, but to learn more, refer to the <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/181947">Google AdSense</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/?utm_medium=et&amp;utm_source=dfp_sb_support_tab&amp;utm_campaign=dfp_sb#topic=13148">Google DoubleClick</a> help centers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose the ads platform best suited to your site. We recommend the <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/start/">AdSense</a> platform for most sites, and the <a href="http://www.google.com/doubleclick/publishers/">DoubleClick platform</a> for sites with their own advertising teams.</li>
            <li>Ads work best when they integrate nicely in your site; their color, content, size, and location enhance user experience.</li>
            <li>Users click on ads that are relevant to the content they are looking for; understand how ads targeting works so that you can maximize your revenue.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="choose-the-best-ads-platform-for-your-site">Choose the best ads platform for your site</h2>
        <p>There are many ad serving platforms available, and choosing the one that is right for you is important. We recommend the <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/start/">Google AdSense platform</a> for most sites; it’s free use and available to almost any site. The <a href="https://www.google.com/doubleclick/publishers/">DoubleClick platform</a> is best for sites with their own advertising teams.</p>
        <p>Google AdSense is a free, simple way for sites of all sizes to earn money by displaying targeted ads. AdSense shows ads that are relevant to your users with automatic targeting. You do not need to manage inventory or advertiser relationships, AdSense gives you instant and automatic access to a huge source of advertiser demand.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>AdSense also provides you with the tools you need to be successful, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/160374">customization tools</a> to change the look and feel of your ads.</li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2973289">Performance tools</a> to monitor and optimize your ad performance.</li>
            <li>Tools to <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2569265">manage payments</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>In addition, AdSense provides the ability to choose from a variety of ad sizes and formats, including <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3213689">responsive ads</a> that serve the right sized ad for responsive sites.</p>
        <p>DoubleClick for Publishers is an ad management platform that helps sites sell, schedule, deliver, and measure all of their ad inventory. Sites can reserve some, or all of their inventory for ads from their own dedicated advertising sales teams or auction-based services like AdSense or AdExchange.</p>

        <h2 id="get-the-most-from-your-ads">Get the most from your ads</h2>
        <p>Place ads where they are visible, but don’t detract from the main user experience.</p>
        <p><img alt="Common examples of where to place mobile ads" src="images/mobile_ads_placement.png" />
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>For example, 320×100px ads may be interspersed through list content, articles may include a 300×250px ads, and long form content may include a combination of ads. Refer to <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1282097">Best practices for ad placement</a> in the AdSense help for further details.</p>
        <p>For the most flexibility, use responsive ads. Responsive ads are automatically sized based on the user’s device.</p>
        <p><img alt="Sample website with ads on desktop and mobile" src="images/ad-ss-600.png" srcset="images/ad-ss-1200.png 1200w,            images/ad-ss-900.png 900w,           images/ad-ss-600.png 600w,            images/ad-ss-300.png 300w" />
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>It may be necessary to use statically sized ads, in this case, refer to the <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6002621">Guide to ad sizes</a>.</p>
        <p>To maximize the ad inventory available to you, be sure to choose both text and display ads.</p>
        <p><img src="images/mobileimage.png" />
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>In many cases, you have control over the color, font, and font-sizing for text ads. Choose styles that match or contrast the styles on your site.</p>
        <p><img src="images/mobiletext_withcolor.png" />
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>For example, you can change the color of URL text so that users see clearly where the link will take them.</p>

        <h2 id="how-ads-are-targeted">How ads are targeted</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Google AdSense automatically delivers ads that are <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9713">targeted to your content or audience</a>. This is done in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content and language</strong> - users will see ads that match your site’s content and language.</li>
            <li><strong>Placement</strong> - advertisers can target sites that have ad units placed where they want their ads to appear, and matched to the size they want their ads to be displayed in on targeted devices.</li>
            <li><strong>User’s interest</strong> - your website and advertisers can target specific user groups, for example, sports enthusiasts.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="how-ads-are-selected">How ads are selected</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/160525">ad auction</a> is used to select the ads that will appear on your pages and determine how much you’ll earn from those ads. In a traditional auction, interested bidders state the maximum price they’re willing to pay to buy a specific item. Similarly, our ad auction allows advertisers to state the price they’re willing to pay for clicks on ads or for impressions served on AdSense pages.</p>

    </section>
    <section>
        <p>In order to serve ads on your site, you’ll need an active AdSense account. If you don’t already have one, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">create one</a> and agree to the AdSense terms of service. When you create your account, you’ll need to verify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are at least 18 years old and have a verified Google Account.</li>
            <li>You own a live website or other online content that complies with <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182">Google AdSense program policies</a>; ads are hosted on this site.</li>

        <h2 id="create-ad-units">Create ad units</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>An ad unit is a set of ads that are displayed on your page as a result of JavaScript you add to your page. You have three options for sizing your ad units:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3213689">Responsive (Recommended)</a></strong>.</li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6002621">Pre-defined</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3289364">Custom-sized</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>You are building a responsive site; use responsive ad units. Responsive ads automatically resize based on the size of the device and the width of the parent container. Responsive ads work in line with your responsive layout, ensuring your site looks great on any device.</p>
        <p>If you don’t use responsive ad units, you will have to write a lot more code to control how ads appear based on a user’s device. Even if you must specify the exact size of your ad units, use responsive ad units in <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/monetization/ads/customize-ads.html#what-if-responsive-sizing-isnt-enough">advanced mode</a>.</p>
        <p>To make your code simpler and save you time and effort, the responsive ad code automatically adapts the ad unit size to your page layout. The code calculates the required size dynamically based on the width of the ad unit’s parent container, then picks the best-performing ad size that fits in the container. For example, a mobile-optimized site with a width of 360px might show a 320x50 ad unit.</p>
        <p>Track the current <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6002621#top">top performing ad sizes</a> in the Google AdSense <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6002621#top">Guide to ad sizes</a>.</p>
        <p>After creating your ad unit, AdSense provide a snippet of code to include on your site, similar to the code below:</p><pre><code>&lt;script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- Top ad in web starter kit sample --&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>data-ad-client</code> and <code>data-ad-slot</code> will be unique for each ad you generate.</li>
            <li>The <code>data-ad-format=auto</code> tag in the generated ad code enables the smart sizing behavior for the responsive ad unit.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="include-ad-units-in-your-site">Include ad units in your site</h2>
        <p>To include the ad on the page, we need to paste the provided AdSense snippet into our markup. If you want to include multiple ads, you can either re-use the same ad unit, or create multiple ad units.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Remember</p>
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Never place ads where they might interfere with a user's intended experience on your site; ensure ads above the fold don't push important content below it.</li>
            <li>Always use responsive ad units; if smart sizing isn't enough, switch to advanced mode.</li>
            <li>Look for opportunities to integrate ads throughout the content to avoid ad blindness.</li>

            <li>Pages with excessive ads, ads that push important content down below the fold, ads clustered together that dominate the viewable space or ads without clear labeling lead to lower user satisfaction and are against AdSense policies.</li>

        <h2 id="check-scorecards-and-recommendations">Check scorecards and Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Use the scorecard on the <b><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/app#home">Home</a></b> tab of your account to check how well your ad settings, webpages and content are performing compared to those of other AdSense publishers.</p>
        <p>Scorecard is organized into different categories (revenue optimization, site health, etc.), provides a score of one to five blue dots. Each score indicates the ranking relative to other publishers in that particular category. While a lower score in a category means there are potential areas for improvement, pay special attention to items flagged with a red or yellow exclamation mark.</p>
        <p>The <b>Recommendation box</b> on the <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/app#home">Home</a> tab offers recommendations how your site could be changed to earn more revenue. These recommendations are based on analyzing the performance of recommendations that have been recently implemented by other AdSense publishers and are only provided when there is a high confidence of increased performance.</p>

        <p>The higher the competition, or ‘auction pressure’, the more the advertiser will pay to be viewed and clicked on your site. To maximize your bidding potential:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be sure to allow both <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/185665">text</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/185666">display ads</a>. Excluding one type of ads limits the number of advertisers available to you.</li>
            <li>Use ad sizes that are popular with advertisers, see the <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6002621">Guide to ad sizes</a>.</li>
            <li>In some cases, certain ads may not blend well with your content, be careful about blocking too many categories as it will lower your potential earnings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="dont-block-the-adsense-crawler">Don’t block the AdSense crawler</h2>
        <p>Verify that the <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608">robots.txt</a> file on your site <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/10532">doesn’t block the AdSense crawler</a>. AdSense needs to be able to process and index the content of web pages and uses the AdSense crawler to visit your site and determine its content. This allows AdSense to provide relevant ads.</p>
        <p>To update the <code>robots.txt</code> file to grant the AdSense crawler access to your pages, <em>remove</em> the following two lines of text from your <code>robots.txt</code>:</p><pre><code>User-agent: Mediapartners-Google
Disallow: /</code></pre>
