        <h3>Autoprefixer</h3>
        <p>If you want a quick way to add vendor prefixes to your CSS, you can do so with this handy plugin.</p>
        <p>Write CSS, ignoring vendor prefixes and when you want to add them, hit <code>ctrl+shift+p</code> and type <code>Autoprefix CSS</code>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/tools/build/setupbuildprocess.html">We cover how you can automate this in your build process</a>, that way your CSS stays lean and you don’t need to remember to hit <code>ctrl+shift+p</code>.</p>

        <h2>Set Up Command Line Shortcuts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make the command line work for you; create aliases that are easy to remember and fast to type.</li>
            <li>Give Github dotfiles a try to save, share and sync up your command line shortcuts.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="how-to-set-them-up">How to Set Them Up</h2>
        <p>The easiest way create command-line shortcuts is to add aliases for common commands to your bashrc file. On Mac or Linux:</p>
        <pre><code> open -a 'Sublime Text' ~/.bashrc</code></pre>
        <p>Add a new alias, for example:</p><pre><code> alias master='git checkout master'</code></pre>

        <p>Anytime you are in a directory with a git repo, you can run the command <code>master</code> and it will checkout the master branch for you.</p>
        <p>Note: See these instructions for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682057(v=vs.85).aspx">setting up Windows aliases</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="save-share-and-sync-your-shortcuts">Save, Share and Sync Your Shortcuts</h2>
        <p>Store your shortcuts and dot files on Github. The major gain with this is your shortcuts can be shared across devices and they are always backed up.</p>
        <p>Github even created a <a href="http://dotfiles.github.io/">dedicated page for dotfiles</a> and quite a few of the Chrome Team have forked <a href="https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles">Mathias Bynens’ dotfiles</a>.</p>

        <h2>Add a Build Process</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Your build process tools must optimise for performance; they should automatically minify and concatenate JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and images.</li>
            <li>Use tools like LiveReload to make your development process smoother.</li>

        <h2 id="what-is-a-build-process">What Is a Build Process</h2>
        <p>A build process is a set of tasks which run over your projects files, compiling and testing code during development and used to create the deployment version of your site. Your build process shouldn’t be a set of tasks you run at the end of your development workflow.</p>
        <p>The most popular tools for implementing a build process are <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, both of which are command line tools. If you have no experience of either, use Gulp, we use it for <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/">Web Starter Kit</a> and recommend you do the same.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="what-tasks-should-be-in-a-build-process">What Tasks Should be in a Build Process</h2>

        <p>If you are looking to create your own build process and you’re new to Gulp or Grunt, the quick start guides will be the best place to get into on installing and running your first build process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://gruntjs.com/getting-started">Grunt Getting Started</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-started">Gulp Getting Started</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>For those unfamiliar with the terms concatenation and minification, </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Concatenation means simply merging multiple files together, i.e. copying and pasting several files into one. The reason we do this is that it’s more efficient for a browser to fetch one file, rather than lots of small files.</li>
            <li>Minification is the process of taking a file and making the overall number of characters less, without changing how the code works. A good example of this is removing comments, or taking a long variable name and making it smaller. This makes the file size smaller, leading to faster downloads.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>For minification, use the following:</p>

        <h3>Optimise Your Images</h3>
        <p>Image optimisation is an important step to help speed up your site; you’d be surprised how much smaller you can make an image without losing quality. Meta data is removed from the image as it’s not needed by the browser to display the image, for example, information about the camera used to take the photo.</p>
        <p>For optimising images you can use these modules.</p>

        <h2>Use Real Devices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>There's no substitute for running your site on a real device. You must try your site on real devices.</li>
            <li>BrowserSync allows you to synchronise user interactions across a number of devices at the same time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="connect-to-a-local-server">Connect to a Local Server</h2>
        <p>One of the simplest ways to test on a real device, is to simply find the IP address of your computer, run your web server and then point your mobile devices to your computer’s IP address.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="use-port-forwarding-to-connect-to-your-server">Use Port Forwarding to Connect to Your Server</h2>
        <p>It’s often easier and more flexible to test your site using Chromes Port Forwarding feature. This shares localhost sites from your computer, to your phone over USB.</p>
        <p>The first step is to enable USB debugging on your Android device. Go to <strong>Settings &gt; About Phone</strong> and tap the <strong>Build number</strong> seven times. Then return back to the <strong>Settings</strong> screen and select <strong>Developer Options</strong>.</p>
        <p><img alt="Enable USB Debugging" src="images/usb_debugging_on.png" />
        </p>

    <section>
        <p>Check your site running locally. In this example we have a server running on port <strong>3000</strong>, so the URL is <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>:</p>
        <p><img alt="Demo site we are using as an example" src="images/port-forwarding-site-demo.png" />

        <p>Open a new tab in Chrome and type in the URL <code>chrome://inspect</code> and plug your phone in over USB.</p>
        <p><img alt="Chrome Inspect Screenshot" src="images/chrome-inspect.png" />
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Clicking on the <code>Port Forwarding</code> button will allow you to enter the port your server is on as well as a localhost port on your phone.</p>
        <p><img alt="Port Forwarding Settings" src="images/port-forwarding-dialog.png" />
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Make sure the ‘Enable port forwarding’ checkbox at the bottom of the popup is checked. Press ‘Done’ and you’ll be able to open http://localhost:3000 on your mobile device and see your site.</p>

        <h2>Use DevTools Emulation</h2>
        <p>Browser emulation is great for testing a sites responsiveness, but they don’t emulate differences in API, CSS support and certain behaviors that you’d see on a mobile browser. Test your site on browsers running on real devices to be certain everything behaves as expected.</p>

        <h2 id="android-emulator">Android Emulator</h2>
        <p>The Android emulator comes with the Android SDK which you need to <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">download from here</a>.</p>
        <p>Start by opening Android Studio and go to <code>Tools &gt; Android &gt; AVD Manager (Android Virtual Device Manager)</code>. AVD is the place where you set up the emulators you’d like to use.</p>
        <p><img alt="Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager Menu" src="images/android-emulator-adv-manager.png" />
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>To start off, you’ll have no emulators set-up so click <code>Create</code> and we’ll get set-up to emulate a Nexus 5.</p>

        <h2>Use Cloud Based Emulators and Devices</h2>
        <p>If you can’t use the emulators for whatever reason and don't have access to real devices, then cloud based emulators are the next best thing.</p>
        <p>The one big advantage of cloud-based emulators over real devices and local emulators is that you can automate unit tests for your site across different platforms.</p>

        <h2 id="saucelabs">SauceLabs</h2>
        <p><a href="https://saucelabs.com/">SauceLabs (Commercial)</a> allows you to run unit tests inside of an emulator, which can be really useful for scripting a flow through your site and watch the video recording of this afterwards on various devices.</p>
        <p>You can also do manual testing with your site.</p>
